Project Created: Fall 2023
Class: Intro to Programming


This is a very simple program, designed to practice our skills in recursion, graphically representing aspects of our program, and relating it back to real-life by making it change based on the time at any given second. This program uses "library.h", which is a library given to us by our professor that allows us to create a window and draw on it. 

This clocks works in real time, so you can actually see the second, minute, and hour hands of the clock moving, as well as the time on top. How it works is the clock is constantly updating, so each time it moves something forward, lets say the second hand, it also will erase the spot where that hand previously was. Draw, erase, draw, eraes, draw, erase... This goes on constantly, giving the illusion the clock is actually moving smoothly.
