This was a simple project designed to allow us to see how prolog differs from other coding languages. Earlier in the semester we completed the farmer-fox-chicken-corn problem using python. This time we had to do the same problem, this time in prolog, allowing us to the see the differences. Further, we were not allowed to use negation, so everything had to be defined in positive terms.
