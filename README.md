# Projects
Various projects that I have worked on during my coding journey. They start simple, such as creating a clock or simple cannon game, and evolve into advanced calculators and graphical representations of the shortest path between two places.

They are organized into different folders based on what language they were coded in. The README.md in each file details when the project was completed and what class, if any, it was for.
