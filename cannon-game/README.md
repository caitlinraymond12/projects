Project Created: Fall 2023
Class: Intro to Programming

This idea behind this game is a simple one: you input a velocity and angle, and try to hit the enemy base. On each play of the game, the enemy base moves. There is also a guard wall that you cannot hit or the also lose the game. 

The interesting thing about this assignment, is that it had to be completely rrecursive, we were not allowed to use loops of any kinds. 

In this class, my teacher gave us a library include that he created himself, "library.h", which allowed me to use functions such as move_to(), set_heading_degrees(), and others that made it possible for me to easily draw and program the canon scene. 


In order to draw what the user puts in, the program calculates what the trajectory would look like, and draws many points very close together in order to make it look smooth.
