##	Problem Description

The objective of this experiment is to design, implement, and optimize an ASM checking 
whether two inputs, input A and input B, are equal for four consecutive clock cycles. If so, the 
ASM should output a 1. After designing the ASM, we implemented the ASM in six different 
styles: with either a one-state (one register) or two-state (two register) design, and with either 
binary, one-hot, or grey style encoding for each of the states. We tested and compared path 
delays, power consumption, area, and RTL schematics for each design. We selected the best 
design, the two-state one-hit design, and implemented it on the Nexys A7 board, using a button 
press to simulate the clock cycle, switches for the inputs A and B, and LED lights to show the 
final output on the board.
