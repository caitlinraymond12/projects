##	Problem Description

The objective of the experiment was to implement a 4-bit full adder and subtractor connected 
to a 7-segment display. This was achieved by implementing a 1-bit half adder, then implementing 
a 1-bit full adder using two of the 1-bit half adders. Then, we connected four of the 1-bit full adders 
to create a 4-bit adder/subtractor module with a SUB input to indicate whether we perform 
subtraction or addition. The 1-bit adders were implemented via structural modeling, the 4-bit 
adder/subtractor was implemented with dataflow modeling, and the 7-segment display was 
implemented via modifying the code provided in the tutorial. We combined the 4-bit 
adder/subtractor unit with our seven segment display unit in order to display the two inputs and the 
result of their operation on the displays, while also indicating whether the result is negative or 
experiencing overflow via the led lights on the board.
