##	Problem Description

The objective of this experiment was to design and implement an n-bit divider on the NEXYS4
FPGA board using Verilog. The divider was composed of a control unit that sent a control word to the
datapath, and a datapath that utilized the control word to perform a specific action, and sent feedback to
the control unit. Both were connected in a top-level module that coordinated the inputs and outputs and
each, and it is capable of performing division for numbers containing up to n-bits. The program is able to
be downloaded onto a NEXYS4 board where the user is able to put in their own numbers, up to 7 bits
each, and the result will be displayed using the board’s LEDs.
