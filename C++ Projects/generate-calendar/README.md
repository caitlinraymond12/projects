Project Created: Fall 2023
Class: Intro to Programming

This lab was my first experience coding in a terminal using UNIX. All my previous experience had been on Visual Studio code. 

In this program, the user is prompted to enter in a month (a number between 1 and 12) and a year. No calendars are pulled from any online sources, they are all made within my program by taking in the year, calculating if it's a leap year or not, then neatly printing out days in month and what day of the week the month starts on. The calender will also print out the month before and the month after. 

Example

Input:
```
Type a month: 3
Type a year: 1345
```

Output:

```
    February 1345
